Four in a Row player
--------------------

In Feb. 2011 [ibuildings] hosted a challenge about hacking a four-in-a-row virtual player. 

All the submitted players competed against each other in a tournament and the winner won a prize (hurray) unfortunately I didn't win - but my entry was [mentioned] as a very tiny and interesting implementation :)
